You will implement the code in file "FILE" necessary to achieve the goal is achieved.
Represent the output file like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

Implement all placeholders in the file named "FILE"
Do NOT modify any other files beside FILE

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

If you do not wish to make any changes to FILE, then respond with "no changes".
