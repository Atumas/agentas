You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal. Use placeholders for functions and methods but define ALL functions, classes and other structures that are needed.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file
You may implement smaller functions
For each function or method that isn't implemented make sure to add a comment indicating so with a short description or comment documenting the function or method.

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
def my_func():
		# IMPLEMENT: Should print "hello world"
```

Do not comment on what every file does. It is imperative that the task can be completed by only implementing the functions and methods, no other changes should be necessary.
